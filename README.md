  <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m
    <a href="https://www.allyssapanganiban.com/" ><b>Allyssa</b></a>!
  </h1>
  
  ðŸŽ“ I am currently a third-year student at Villanova University studying CS with a minor in Business (AI/ML). 

  ðŸ’» My primary interests currently lie in front-end development and data science - I love creating comprehensive applications that enhance the user experience. Simultaneously, I uncover insights from data to drive decision-making and innovation.

  ðŸ“š Outside of work, you can find me curled up reading a book, watching dramas, or exploring the city. I also love following the developments of science on my free time.
